                <!-- faq answer -->

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p> We are a local and small business, so we prefer to handle the money businesses after the appointment has ended. We accept cash or credit
                    card. We calculate the amount of money needed for an appointment based on two things: amount of bathrooms and amount of bedrooms. Bedrooms include kitchens, living rooms, and any other rooms. 
                    For weekly appointments, each bedroom is worth 20$ and each bathroom is worth $10. For biweekly appointments, each bedroom is worth 30$ and each bathroom is worth $20. For monthly appointment, each bedroom is worth 40$ and each bathroom worth $25.
                    NOTE: PREORDERED APPOINTMENTS ARE COMING in FEBRUARY 2023. </p>

                    <p> We're a local business. Our appointments guarantee satisfaction, and if you're not happy with us, we can reimburse your money or clean potentially more. We're also working with eco-friendly products to keep our environment
                    safe and healthy, so you can count on us to keep the enivronment safe. We're also very affordable, and we know how hard it can be to find a reliable, cheap cleaning service, so we decided to be that business. Our locality with Circle C
                    also helps us in keeping in touch with our customers very well to satisfy their needs.</p>
