			<br>
			<br>
			<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Ahantya is a dedicated member and CEO of the Spotless Sweepers. As he grew up in Circle C with his little brother, he realized that growing a family required a lot of help. A noticable example was cleaning the house because of messes made by little children. So, when he was old enough, he created a business called the Spotless Sweepers along with his brothers. Outside of the Spotless Sweepers, he enjoys playing golf, watching anime, playing video games, and spending time with his family. </p>

			<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Joe, the brothers' cousins, is the advisor for the Spotless Sweepers. If there's any problems between the brothers or the business that the others don't know how to handle, Joe is able to help with his experience of his father who handles a business. Although his job seems to be easier than the other two, he is highly needed as the Spotless Sweepers is only a local business. Outside of the Spotless Sweepers, he enjoys painting, collecting stones, sleeping, and hanging out with his friends. </p>
