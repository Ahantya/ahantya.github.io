                <h1 class="faq-page">How do I Pay for my Appointment?</h1>

                <!-- faq answer -->

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p> We are a local and small business, so we prefer to handle the money businesses after the appointment has ended. We accept cash or credit
                    card. We calculate the amount of money needed for an appointment based on two things: amount of bathrooms and amount of bedrooms. Bedrooms include kitchens, living rooms, and any other rooms. 
                    For window cleaning, each window is $5 to clean and mop. For our bathroom cleaning service, each bathroom is $13 to clean. For furniture refurbishing, the prices vary because of the size of the furniture, however a general price is about $35 for all of your furniture. For the full house package, each bedroom is $20 to clean and each bathroom is $10 to clean with window cleaning, furniture refurbishing, and a car clean for free
                        NOTE: PREORDERED APPOINTMENTS ARE COMING in FEBRUARY 2023. </p>
