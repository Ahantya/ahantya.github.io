      <p class="role">CEO</p>
      <p> Ahantya is a dedicated member and CEO of the Spotless Sweepers. As he grew up in Circle C with his little brother, he realized that growing a family required a lot of help. 
	  A noticable example was cleaning the house because of messes made by little children. So, when he was old enough, he created a business called the Spotless Sweepers along with his brothers. Outside of the Spotless Sweepers, 
	    he enjoys playing golf, watching anime, playing video games, and spending time with his family. </p>
